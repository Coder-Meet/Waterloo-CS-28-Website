# Waterloo-CS-28-Website
A website that allows its users to display their own websites

You start off on the login page then you can either login directly or signup. Going to the signup page you then can make an account and once done you are taken to the home page. The home page currently is simply a list of websites but in the future, it will be a grid with snapshots, profile pictures, and website descriptions. As for now, those with some experience please help out in making the login, signup, and home pages better and adding functionality. Those with less experience please focus on making your personal website.
